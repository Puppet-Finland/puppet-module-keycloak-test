# puppet-module-keycloak-test

This repository aims to make running of puppet-module-keycloak Docker-based
Beaker acceptance tests easier. It can also be used to run unit tests and run
validation.

This repository is useful only if you don't want or can't run Docker and all
the other requirements on your development workstation.

# Setup

The Vagrantfile assumes that it can find ../puppet-module-keycloak where you
develop the code. If that is the case then you should be able to just

    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd puppet-module-keycloak

Then run any tests you need with pdk.

# Running validation

    $ pdk validate

# Running unit tests

    $ pdk test unit

# Running acceptance tests

Ensure that you have run

    $Â pdk bundle install

in the puppet-module-keycloak directory.

You should be able to launch acceptance tests of your choosing with

    BEAKER_PUPPET_COLLECTION=puppet6 \
    BEAKER_set=centos-7 \
    BEAKER_destroy=yes \
    pdk bundle exec rspec

If you want to target a specific test file add

    spec/acceptance/1_class_spec.rb

to the end of the above command-line. You may want to create a separate file to
reduce initial development time further.

Check puppet-module-keycloak/.github/workflows/ci.yaml for a list of
environment variables you can customize.
